If there is one thing in the world that will make a man peculiarly and insufferably self-conceited, it is to have his stomach behave itself, the first day at sea, when nearly all his comrades are seasick.

It is a fine day.”</p><p>He put his hand on his stomach and said, “Oh, my!” and then staggered away and fell over the coop of a skylight.</p><p>Presently another old gentleman was projected from the same door with great violence. I said:</p><p>“Calm yourself, Sir—There is no hurry. It is a fine day, Sir.”</p></div> </div>
