Do not know its name—do not wish to know it—want to go to bed. Two horses lame (mine and Jack’s and the others worn out. Jack and I walked three or four miles, over the hills, and led the horses. Fun—but of a mild type.”) </p></blockquote><p>Twelve or thirteen hours in the saddle, even in a Christian land and a Christian climate, and on a good horse, is a tiresome journey; but in an oven like Syria, in a ragged spoon of a saddle that slips fore-and-aft, and “thort-ships,” and every way, and on a horse that is tired and lame, and yet must be whipped and spurred with hardly a moment’s cessation all day long, till the blood comes from his side, and your conscience hurts you every time you strike if you are half a man,—it is a journey to be remembered in bitterness of spirit and execrated with emphasis for a liberal division of a man’s lifetime.</p><hr class="section"></div> </div>
